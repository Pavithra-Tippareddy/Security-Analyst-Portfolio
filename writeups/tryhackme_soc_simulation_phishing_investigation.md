**Date Completed:** October 22, 2025  
**Platform:** [TryHackMe SOC Simulation (Public Summary)](https://tryhackme.com/soc-sim/public-summary/f0b88796daa1d9b9a38cc3d5b879096f8c09309121110082775588fb3a9900fe14915cc9049f839059deb584a254b4e4)  
**Tools Used:** Splunk (SIEM), Email Analysis, Threat Intelligence Lookup

## üß† Objective
Investigate an alert for an inbound phishing email containing a suspicious shortened URL.  
Determine if any internal users accessed the malicious link, and classify the incident based on findings.

   - No hits found in firewall, proxy, or DNS logs.
   - Indicates the user did **not click** the link.
